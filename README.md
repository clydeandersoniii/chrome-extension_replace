Hi there!  This is a simple macro extension that allows the user to create text macros.
It should work on most input boxes including those that are actually just div tags marked as content-editable.

Here's an example:
1. Add a Macro

2. Use Macro

It's fairly simple and straightforward, so hopefully you can find some use for it!
